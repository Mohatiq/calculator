This is a calculator project I created while studying web development. I used ChatGPT for the styling of the page since Iâ€™m not a fan of designing web pages, and I also used it to help solve some logic bugs in my script.js code.
Here is the live preview of the calculator https://mohatiq.github.io/calculator/
